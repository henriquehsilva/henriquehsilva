I'm a self-taught developer who made the transition from business administration to web development 7+ years ago.
Most of my experience comes from working as a full-stack developer (albeit a little more back-end oriented) in companies of different sizes and in various sectors such as education, healthcare, finance and Gov.
I enjoy writing clean and maintainable code, solving complex problems and exchanging knowledge with my colleagues.
My hobby is to write development related subjects on my blog https://henriquesilva.dev
